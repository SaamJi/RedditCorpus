# Let's pwn some n00bs!
Have you ever checked out a reddit thread or facebook group and found you didn't understand a thing that was being said?

This project is aiming to understand jargon and how it evolves on the internet. We're building algorithms to detect jargon on the internet and  compiling a corpus of *every single comment ever made on Reddit* to test it out. We're curious to see how words grow on the internet, and how new acronyms, jargon, lingo, or misspellings move from one community to another.
